This markdown shows the codes used for each condition,
along with any amendments made to the CALIBER code lists. 
These amendment lists were derived from the "Create_disease_list" & "examiningcodes" files, 
with some edits made after looking at the distribution of test value results in our sample of 1m patients. 

All the algorithms are based on the CALIBER algorithms developed for use in CPRD GOLD, 
adapted here for use in CPRD Aurum for our specific study on temporal & equity trends in
multimorbidity within the English GP-registered population
The original CALIBER phenotyping algorithms: https://www.caliberresearch.org/portal/phenotypes/chronological-map


We are interested in chronic conditions that affect health, healthcare usage, and future risk of disease. We have modified the CALIBER algorithms to this effect. 

We have removed all "history of" / "H/O" codes, on the assumption that other observations would be recorded if the condition was an 'active' health problem.
Other amendments to CALIBER algorithms are detailed below. 

## Implementation 

Unless otherwise specified, an individual is considered to have a condition if they have at least 1 of the relevant codes ever recorded. 
Date of 'diagnosis' is assumed to be date of the first observation. 

Multiple visit criteria - conditions with 'multiple visit criteria' need at least 3 of the relevant codes recorded within a 12 month period to be included. Date of 'diagnosis' is assumed to be date of the third observation within 12 months. When this criteria has been met once, the individual is considered to have this condition. 

Some conditions have further, more specific implementations, which are noted below. 

## Variables

read code: Read Code VT3 recording system used in Primary Care. These are the codes from the original CALIBER lists

medcode:  codes used in CPRD GOLD observation files, matching one-to-one with Read codes. 

decription: descriptive term (from either 'description' in GOLD dictionary, or 'term' in Aurum dictionary)

category: condition category as defined in CALIBER lists. Blank for additional codes mapped from Aurum dictionary

medcodeid: codes used in CPRD Aurum observation files. 

snomedctdescriptionid: Snomed CT recording system used in Primary Care (replacing the Read code system)

mapping: how read codes from original CALIBER mapped to CPRD aurum code: a. cleansedreadcode - GOLD Read code matched Aurum 'cleansedreadcode' b. originalreadcode - GOLD Read code matched Aurum 'originalreadcode' c. description - GOLD description matched Aurum 'term' d. termsearch - codes identified by searching Aurum for similar terms to original CALIBER GOLD list

## 31	Chronic Kidney Disease	7	Diseases of the Genitourinary System
Includes End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), which is a separate category in CALIBER
CALIBER Algorithm:
"A patient is defined as having had CKD stage 3 or above at a specified date:

IF egfr_ckdepi recorded on or before specified date, THEN 
IF egfr_ckdepi <60 ml/min on the most recent date (index date) before the specified date
AND
IF egfr_ckdepi <60 ml/min on any date greater than 90 days BEFORE the index date above
THEN classify as having CKD3 or above
ELSE the patient is not defined as having CKD stage 3 or above.

Where egfr_ckdepi up to and including 31 Dec 2013 is defined as:

Creatinine values were excluded if <20 micromol/L (0.2 mg/dL) or > 1800 micromol/L (20 mg/dL)  'biological plausability limits': https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.liverpool.idm.oclc.org/doi/epdf/10.1002/pds.2203 
After looking at distributions assumed that all units were in mmmol/L (regardless of stated units)



In addition to the Kuan eGFR algorithm, also using diagnostic codes. 
These were identified through searching the Aurum database. 
Selected codes match those used by https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/10.2217/cer-2019-0190 

Combining with ESRD, taking the first record only

## 90	Low HDL-C	5	Diseases of the Endocrine System
CALIBER Algorithm:
"Primary care
1. IF FEMALE the lowest value EVER recorded for HDL Cholesterol for a patient on or before the specified date is less than:
a) serum: 1.2 mmol/L
OR
b) serum: 46.404 mg/dL
OR
c) plasma: 1.1650 mmol/L
OR
d) plasma: 45.0524 mg/dL

2. IF MALE the lowest value EVER recorded for HDL Cholesterol for a patient on or before the specified date is less than:
a) serum: 1 mmol/L
OR
b) serum: 38.67 mg/dL
OR
c) plasma: 0.9709 mmol/L
OR
d) plasma: 37.5437 mg/dL"



We are requiring 2 or more abnormal values ever recorded - this is to help avoid misclassifying single abnormal measures & 
to be in line with NICE guidance that treatment starts after 1 abnormal measurement & is then followed up by a second measurement after 3 months https://pathways.nice.org.uk/pathways/cardiovascular-disease-prevention/lipid-modification-therapy-for-preventing-cardiovascular-disease 

After looking at distributions assumed that all units were in mmmol/L (regardless of stated units)
Only values where 0 < x < 50mmol/l were included

CALIBER Algorithm:
"1. Obesity diagnosis or history of diagnosis or procedure during a consultation 
OR
2. IF  enttype = 13 (Weight) available on or before specified date AND data3 not missing, BMI = data3. If BMI > 30, patient is defined as having had Obesity.
OR
3. If enttype = 13 (Weight) available on or before specified date AND data3 missing, BMI = data1 (enttype 13) /(data2 ^2) (enttype 14 = Height). If BMI > 30, patient is defined as having had Obesity. IF height not available on same eventdate as weight, use most recent height for age > 18 years."


Only using bmi/heght/weight recorded age 18 above
We are requiring 2 records of obese bmi ever recorded - would rather not count than misclassify as obese
BMI values restricted to 10 < x < 200
weight values: After looking at recorded units & distributions, if not specified as in imperial measurements, assume in kg. restricted to 5kg < x < 500kg
height values: After looking at recorded units & distributions, units assumed to be in m if x < 3 & in cm if >3.  restricted to 0.5m< x < 2.5m.
